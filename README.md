## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Sailing to Bermuda was created quickly with `create-react-app` and tested using `Cypress`.  The project spec required we use a company logo and match fonts to match the spec that was provided.  On this application a user enter a boat racers end time or multiple racers end times, then click submit to see the average total race times for all the data entered.
